Blank app with authentication powered by Devise. User registration is disabled to the public, only registered users who have admin privileges can create users. Registered (non-admin) users will only be able to change their own password, all user registration and modification is handled by the admin. The ability to disable users (is_active) is also provided.

To create a new user:

1. rails c
2. user = User.new(:name => 'Your Name', :email => 'youremail@gmail.com', :password => 'password', :password_confirmation => 'password')
user.save

Right now is_admin is protected, so you will need to manually give your first user admin privileges (e.g. update users set is_admin="1" where id="1")

This app also uses Ryan Bate's solution for dynamic attr_accessible, allowing admin users to do mass-assignment while preventing regular non-admin users from elevating privileges. If you want to add this to your own app:
